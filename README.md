# graphql-with-react

Following along with FEM client-side GraphQL with React. 

Idea is to have the data on the server modeled after props for front-end, have props and server data be the exact same shape. Eliminate need for transformations. This was where it started. 

It's evolved since then. It's its own language / process to build schema for anything.
